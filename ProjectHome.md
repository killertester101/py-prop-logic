This is an implementation of propositional logic based on the pseudocode from Russel and Norvig's "Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach".
It includes negation as failure through the special keyword "Not(...)". It is written entirely in Python, and it works through the generators so it is easily integrated in your own python code.

It is not a full featured Prolog engine, but negation as failure is included.
